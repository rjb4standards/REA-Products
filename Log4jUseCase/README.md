<h2>Apache Log4j SBOM Materials</h2>
These Apache Log4j SBOM files were created from a binary (zip file) distribution of Log4j version 2.15.0. <b>FileChecksums at the SBOM component level should be ignored as they only represent the file hash for the primary component, appearing in the Package object</b>.
<p>
An SBOM representing the Apache Log4j 2.17.0 CORE classes are also provided as a separate SBOM in SPDX TV and JSON formats and a complete Vulnerability Disclosure Report, open-source format containing FixStatus and Vendor Analysis Findings as placeholder elements. 

<b>NOTE:
The VDR clearly shows the need to have SBOM data aligned with NIST NVD data; the Log4j CVE 44228 is not associated with any of the SBOM components listed in the SBOM; this really needs to be addressed. Please promote the alignemnt of SBOM data with NIST NVD data in order to improve vulnerability search results on SBOM's. </b>
