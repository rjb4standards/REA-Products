 This example shows a simple SBOM in SPDX TagValue format along with an initial baseline SBOM Vulnerability Disclosure Report (SBOM VDR) that were created with SAG-PM (TM). A software vendor can create their SBOM and SBOMVDR baselines in seconds using SAG-PM (TM). Vendors are expected to update their baseline SBOM VDR's based on careful analysis of each reported CVE. The vendor is required to update the SBOMVDR UnresovledVulnerabilities and VulnDisclosureCreateDate attributes after analyzing and updating each reported CVE in the baseline SBOMVDR.
