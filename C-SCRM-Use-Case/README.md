<h2>C-SCRM Use Case Materials based on Amazon AWS Client Software</h2>
<p>
  Ease of Implementation (EoI) is a critical success factor for software vendor and consumer adoption of C-SCRM software supply chain risk assessment practices as part of a comprensive, and effective risk management control capability. We must stop ransomware from causing damages and disruptions to our economy, especially small and medium buinesses, which are frequent targets of these attacks. The Software Assurance Guardian (SAG) (TM) Point Man (SAG-PM) (TM) is designed, and priced, to help small and medium businesses (SMB) achieve best practice protections against harmful software, based on NIST SP 800-161 R2 standards and guidelines, documented in Appendix F. Frequently, SMB's lack the cybersecurity expertise and skills on staff that are often found in larger organizations. Software consumers need an easy to use (EOU) method to implement effective C-SCRM controls. SAG-PM achieves both EOR and EOU, making it very easy for software consumers to get started on Executive Order 14028 and C-SCRM best practices. 
<p>
  Software Vendors are the primary source of information that is needed by a software consumer performing a C-SCRM risk assessment on a software product. The materials contained in this folder contains examples of each artifact that a software vendor will be required to provide software consumers, in order to satisfy C-SCRM and Executive Order 14028 requirements. 
  <h3> One Vendor provided URL and one Vendor Response File (VRF) are Sufficient for EOI</h3>
<p>
  The software vendor must provide a software customer with information that is needed by SAG-PM (TM) to perform a risk assessment. A software vendor must make available a downloadable file that a SAG-PM (TM) customer can use to add vendor product information into the SAG-PM Database.  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rjb4standards/REA-Products/master/C-SCRM-Use-Case/AWSCLI.csv"> The AWSCLI.csv file contains this information.</a> A SAG-PM customer adds this vendor information to the SAG-PM database using the sag-pm software addProduct function that is provided by SAG-PM product. Once this data has been added to the database a consumer may perform a C-SCRM risk assessment on a software object. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rjb4standards/REA-Products/master/C-SCRM-Use-Case/VendorResponse.txt">A Vendor Response File (VRF)</a> contains the information needed to conduct a comprehensive NIST compliant C-SCRM software risk assessment for Executive Order 14028. including the following materials:
