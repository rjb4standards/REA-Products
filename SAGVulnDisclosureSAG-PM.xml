		<SAG:CVE>
      			<SAG:CVEID>CVE-2020-36242</SAG:CVEID>
      			<SAG:CVSS>9.1</SAG:CVSS>
      			<SAG:CVEDescription>In the cryptography package before 3.3.2 for Python, certain sequences of update calls to symmetrically encrypt multi-GB values could result in an integer overflow and buffer overflow, as demonstrated by the Fernet class.</SAG:CVEDescription>
      			<SAG:FixStatus>N/A</SAG:FixStatus>
      			<SAG:AnalysisFindings>This vulnerability is exploited during file encryption. SAG-PM does not perform file encryption using this component and is most likely not vulnerable to this CVE</SAG:AnalysisFindings>

      			<SAG:CVEID>CVE-2014-8564</SAG:CVEID>
      			<SAG:CVSS>5.0</SAG:CVSS>
      			<SAG:CVEDescription>The _gnutls_ecc_ansi_x963_export function in gnutls_ecc.c in GnuTLS 3.x before 3.1.28, 3.2.x before 3.2.20, and 3.3.x before 3.3.10 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write) via a crafted (1) Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) certificate or (2) certificate signing requests (CSR), related to generating key IDs.</SAG:CVEDescription>
      			<SAG:FixStatus>N/A</SAG:FixStatus>
      			<SAG:AnalysisFindings>This vulnerability is exploited when Elliptic curve certificates are used. SAG-PM does not perform any elliptic curve certificate functions from this component and is most likely not vulnerable to this CVE</SAG:AnalysisFindings>
