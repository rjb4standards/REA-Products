<h1>SBOM Vulnerability Disclosure Report (SBOM VDR)</h1>
<p>
The main difference between the SBOM VDR and CDXVEX reporting formats is that CDXVEX reports on only those software components that have known, reported 
vulnerabilities, using an <b>implicit</b> model, which means software components that have no reported vulnerabilities are not listed in a CDXVEX report. 
  SBOM VDR reports on the vulnerability status of all software components listed in an SBOM, using an <b>explicit</b> model which provides the vulnerability status for components that have no reported vulnerabilities, and those that do have reported vulnerabilities. 
Th explicit model provides software consumers with proof that a software vendor did indeed check every component in an SBOM for vulnerabilities, providing a high degree of confidence in the trustworthiness of a software product.
