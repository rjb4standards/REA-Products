Libgfortran is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the      GNU General Public License for more details.           Under Section 7 of GPL version 3, you are granted additional      permissions described in the GCC Runtime Library Exception, version      3.1, as published by the Free Software Foundation.           You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License and      a copy of the GCC Runtime Library Exception along with this program;      see the files COPYING3 and COPYING.RUNTIME respectively. If not, see      <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.          ----          Full text of license texts referred to above follows (that they are     listed below does not necessarily imply the conditions apply to the     present binary release):          ----          GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION          Version 3.1, 31 March 2009          Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>          Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this     license document, but changing it is not allowed.          This GCC Runtime Library Exception (\"Exception\") is an additional     permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version     3 (\"GPLv3\"). It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that     bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that     the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.          When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of     certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled     program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of     non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the     header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.          0. Definitions.          A file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime     Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an     interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based     on the Runtime Library.          \"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without     modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of     the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any     subsequent versions published by the FSF.          \"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation,     modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with     the license of GCC.          \"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual     target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for     input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution     phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any     format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used     for producing a compiler intermediate representation.          The \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in     non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in     Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,     use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered     part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be     understood as starting with the output of the generators or     preprocessors.          A Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or     with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any     work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to     optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an     Eligible Compilation Process.          1. Grant of Additional Permission.          You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by     combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such     propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that     all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You     may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,     consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.          2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.          The availability of this Exception does not imply any general     presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft     requirements of the license of GCC.          ----                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE                 Version 3, 29 June 2007           Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.                        Preamble           The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for     software and other kinds of works.           The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed     to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,     the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to     share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free     software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the     GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to     any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to     your programs, too.           When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not     price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you     have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for     them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you     want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new     free programs, and that you know you can do these things.           To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you     these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have     certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if     you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.           For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether     gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same     freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive     or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they     know their rights.           Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:     (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License     giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.           For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains     that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and     authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as     changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to     authors of previous versions.           Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run     modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer     can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of     protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic     pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to     use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we     have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those     products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we     stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions     of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.           Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.     States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of     software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to     avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could     make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that     patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.           The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and     modification follow.                      TERMS AND CONDITIONS           0. Definitions.           \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.           \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of     works, such as semiconductor masks.           \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this     License. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and     \"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.           To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work     in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an     exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the     earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.           A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based     on the Program.           To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without     permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for     infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a     computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,     distribution (with or without modification), making available to the     public, and in some countries other activities as well.           To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other     parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through     a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.           An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"     to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible     feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)     tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the     extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the     work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If     the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a     menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.           1. Source Code.           The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work     for making modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source     form of a work.           A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official     standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of     interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that     is widely used among developers working in that language.           The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other     than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of     packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major     Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that     Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an     implementation is available to the public in source code form. A     \"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component     (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system     (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to     produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.           The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all     the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable     work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to     control those activities. However, it does not include the work's     System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free     programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but     which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source     includes interface definition files associated with source files for     the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically     linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,     such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those     subprograms and other parts of the work.           The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users     can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding     Source.           The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that     same work.           2. Basic Permissions.           All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of     copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated     conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited     permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a     covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its     content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your     rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.           You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not     convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains     in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose     of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you     with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with     the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do     not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works     for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction     and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of     your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.           Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under     the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10     makes it unnecessary.           3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.           No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological     measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article     11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or     similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such     measures.           When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid     circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention     is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to     the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or     modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's     users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of     technological measures.           4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.           You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you     receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and     appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;     keep intact all notices stating that this License and any     non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;     keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all     recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.           You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,     and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.           5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.           You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to     produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the     terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:            a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified       it, and giving a relevant date.            b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is       released under this License and any conditions added under section       7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to       \"keep intact all notices\".            c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this       License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This       License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7       additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,       regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no       permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not       invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.            d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display       Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive       interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your       work need not make them do so.           A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent     works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,     and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,     in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an     \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not     used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users     beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work     in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other     parts of the aggregate.           6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.           You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms     of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the     machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,     in one of these ways:            a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product       (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the       Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium       customarily used for software interchange.            b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product       (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a       written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as       long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product       model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a       copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the       product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical       medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no       more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this       conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the       Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.            c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the       written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This       alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and       only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord       with subsection 6b.            d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated       place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the       Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no       further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the       Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to       copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source       may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)       that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain       clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the       Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the       Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is       available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.            e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided       you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding       Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no       charge under subsection 6d.           A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded     from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be     included in conveying the object code work.           A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any     tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,     or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation     into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,     doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular     product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a     typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status     of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user     actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product     is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial     commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent     the only significant mode of use of the product.           \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,     procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install     and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from     a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must     suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object     code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because     modification has been made.           If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or     specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as     part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the     User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a     fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the     Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied     by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply     if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install     modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has     been installed in ROM).           The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a     requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates     for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for     the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a     network may be denied when the modification itself materially and     adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and     protocols for communication across the network.           Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,     in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly     documented (and with an implementation available to the public in     source code form), and must require no special password or key for     unpacking, reading or copying.           7. Additional Terms.           \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this     License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.     Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall     be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent     that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions     apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately     under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by     this License without regard to the additional permissions.           When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option     remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of     it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own     removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place     additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,     for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.           Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you     add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of     that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:            a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the       terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or            b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or       author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal       Notices displayed by works containing it; or            c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or       requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in       reasonable ways as different from the original version; or            d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or       authors of the material; or            e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some       trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or            f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that       material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of       it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for       any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on       those licensors and authors.           All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further     restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you     received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is     governed by this License along with a term that is a further     restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains     a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this     License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms     of that license document, provided that the further restriction does     not survive such relicensing or conveying.           If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you     must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the     additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating     where to find the applicable terms.           Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the     form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;     the above requirements apply either way.           8. Termination.           You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly     provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or     modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under     this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third     paragraph of section 11).           However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright     holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means     prior to 60 days after the cessation.           Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that     copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after     your receipt of the notice.           Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the     licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under     this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently     reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same     material under section 10.           9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.           You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or     run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work     occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission     to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,     nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or     modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do     not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a     covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.           10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.           Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically     receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and     propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible     for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.           An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an     organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an     organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered     work results from an entity transaction, each party to that     transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever     licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could     give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the     Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if     the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.           You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the     rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may     not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of     rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation     (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that     any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for     sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.           11. Patents.           A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this     License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The     work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".           A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims     owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or     hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted     by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,     but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a     consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For     purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant     patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of     this License.           Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free     patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to     make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and     propagate the contents of its contributor version.           In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express     agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent     (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to     sue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent license to a     party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a     patent against the party.           If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,     and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone     to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a     publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,     then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so     available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the     patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner     consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent     license to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\" means you have     actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the     covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work     in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that     country that you have reason to believe are valid.           If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or     arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a     covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties     receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify     or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license     you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered     work and works based on it.           A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within     the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is     conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are     specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered     work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is     in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment     to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying     the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the     parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory     patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work     conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily     for and in connection with specific products or compilations that     contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,     or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.           Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting     any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may     otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.           12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.           If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or     otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not     excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a     covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this     License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may     not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you     to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey     the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this     License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.           13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.           Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have     permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed     under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single     combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this     License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,     but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,     section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the     combination as such.           14. Revised Versions of this License.           The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of     the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will     be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to     address new problems or concerns.           Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the     Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General     Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the     option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered     version or of any later version published by the Free Software     Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the     GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published     by the Free Software Foundation.           If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future     versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's     public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you     to choose that version for the Program.           Later license versions may give you additional or different     permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any     author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a     later version.           15. Disclaimer of Warranty.           THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY     APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT     HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY     OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,     THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR     PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF     ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.           16. Limitation of Liability.           IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING     WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS     THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY     GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE     USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD     PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),     EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF     SUCH DAMAGES.           17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.           If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided     above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,     reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates     an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the     Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a     copy of the Program in return for a fee.                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS                How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs           If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest     possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it     free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.           To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest     to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively     state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least     the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.            <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>       Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>            This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify       it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by       the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or       (at your option) any later version.            This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,       but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of       MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the       GNU General Public License for more details.            You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License       along with this program. If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.          Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.           If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short     notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:            <program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>       This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.       This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it       under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.          The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate     parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands     might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".           You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,     if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.     For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see     <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.           The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program     into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you     may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with     the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General     Public License instead of this License. But first, please read     <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.

All other files which have no copyright comments are original works     produced specifically for use as part of this library, written either     by Rich Felker, the main author of the library, or by one or more     contibutors listed above. Details on authorship of individual files     can be found in the git version control history of the project. The     omission of copyright and license comments in each file is in the     interest of source tree size.          In addition, permission is hereby granted for all public header files     (include/* and arch/*/bits/*) and crt files intended to be linked into     applications (crt/*, ldso/dlstart.c, and arch/*/crt_arch.h) to omit     the copyright notice and permission notice otherwise required by the     license, and to use these files without any requirement of     attribution. These files include substantial contributions from:          Bobby Bingham     John Spencer     Nicholas J. Kain     Rich Felker     Richard Pennington     Stefan Kristiansson     Szabolcs Nagy          all of whom have explicitly granted such permission.          This file previously contained text expressing a belief that most of     the files covered by the above exception were sufficiently trivial not     to be subject to copyright, resulting in confusion over whether it     negated the permissions granted in the license. In the spirit of     permissive licensing, and of not having licensing issues being an     obstacle to adoption, that text has been removed.Copyright (c) 2005-2023, NumPy Developers.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE     ==========================          Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting     Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands     as a successor of a language called ABC. Guido remains Python's     principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.          In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for     National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see https://www.cnri.reston.va.us)     in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the     software.          In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to     BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team. In October of the same     year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became     Zope Corporation. In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see     https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization     created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.     Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.          All Python releases are Open Source (see https://opensource.org for     the Open Source Definition). Historically, most, but not all, Python     releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes     the various releases.            Release     Derived   Year    Owner    GPL-               from                compatible? (1)            0.9.0 thru 1.2       1991-1995  CWI     yes       1.3 thru 1.5.2 1.2     1995-1999  CNRI    yes       1.6       1.5.2    2000    CNRI    no       2.0       1.6     2000    BeOpen.com no       1.6.1      1.6     2001    CNRI    yes (2)       2.1       2.0+1.6.1  2001    PSF     no       2.0.1      2.0+1.6.1  2001    PSF     yes       2.1.1      2.1+2.0.1  2001    PSF     yes       2.1.2      2.1.1    2002    PSF     yes       2.1.3      2.1.2    2002    PSF     yes       2.2 and above  2.1.1    2001-now  PSF     yes          Footnotes:          (1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under       the GPL. All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute       a modified version without making your changes open source. The       GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with       other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.          (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,       because its license has a choice of law clause. According to       CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1       is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.          Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's     direction to make these releases possible.               B. TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR ACCESSING OR OTHERWISE USING PYTHON     ===============================================================          Python software and documentation are licensed under the     Python Software Foundation License Version 2.
