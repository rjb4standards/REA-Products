This is an example of a NIST SBOM Vulnerability Disclosure Report (SBOM VDR) for a software product that has no reported vulnerabilities.

This type of report is NOT possible with VEX because there are no vulnerabilities to report. A VEX and a Security Advisory both require a vulnerability to report on. But some software products have no vulnerabilities, like this case with the whois application.
