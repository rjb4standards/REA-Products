This NIST C-SCRM + NTIA SBOM risk assessment use case demonstrates use of the open source SBOM Vulnerability Disclosure Report with enhancements included in version 1.1.7, including:

- Use of UnresolvedVulnerabilities flag to expedite risk assessment when a vendor indicates that a product SBOM contains components with known vulnerabilities
- Use of the Exploitable Flag to indicate that a particular CVE is exploitable, for a specific SBOM component

These elements enable a software consumer to perform a more efficient, rapid risk assessment when new vulnerabilities are reported
